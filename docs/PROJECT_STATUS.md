# Project Status: Cartona Integration

## Completed
- Integration with Cartona marketplace API for product and order synchronization
- import of products, partners, and orders from Cartona into Odoo
- Dashboard for monitoring sync status and key metrics
- User access controls and security setup for marketplace operations
- Sync price and stock of products when they change (from Odoo to Cartona)

## In Progress / Ongoing
- Real-time order status updates between Odoo and Cartona
- Enhancing error handling and logging for synchronization processes
- Performance optimization for large data syncs
- Continuous improvement based on user feedback and business needs
- Implementing business constraints: When an order status change occurs, the system must first check who delivered the order before updating the status
- Expanding support for additional Cartona features (e.g., promotions, returns)
