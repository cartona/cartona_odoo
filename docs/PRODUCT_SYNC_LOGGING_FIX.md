## Product Sync Logging Fix

### Problem
- Monitoring showed order pull logs but no product sync logs
- Product synchronization operations were not being recorded in the sync log

### Root Cause
The product sync methods in the codebase were not creating log entries in `marketplace.sync.log`, while order pull methods were properly logging operations.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Added Logging to Bulk Product Sync (`marketplace_api.py`)
**Method**: `sync_all_products()`
- **Start Log**: Records when bulk product sync begins
- **Batch Logs**: Records success/failure of each batch of products
- **Summary Log**: Records final results with totals (success/error counts)
- **Empty Log**: Records when no products are enabled for sync

#### 2. Added Logging to Individual Product Sync (`product_template.py`)
**Method**: `_sync_to_marketplaces()`
- **Start Log**: Records when individual product sync begins
- **Success Log**: Records successful product sync with product details
- **Error Log**: Records failed sync attempts with error details
- **Exception Log**: Records any exceptions during sync operations

#### 3. Added Logging to Stock Sync (`product_product.py`)
**Method**: `_sync_stock_to_marketplaces()`
- **Start Log**: Records when stock sync begins for a variant
- **Success Log**: Records successful stock synchronization
- **Error Log**: Records failed stock sync attempts
- **Exception Log**: Records any exceptions during stock sync

### Log Entry Details
Each log entry includes:
- **Marketplace Config**: Which marketplace configuration was used
- **Operation Type**: 'product_sync' or 'stock_sync'
- **Status**: 'info', 'success', 'error', 'warning'
- **Message**: Human-readable description of the operation
- **Record Details**: Model, ID, and name of the product/variant being synced
- **Statistics**: Records processed, successful, and failed counts
- **Error Details**: Detailed error information when operations fail

### Monitoring Dashboard Impact
Now the monitoring dashboard will show:
- **Product Sync Logs**: All bulk and individual product sync operations
- **Stock Sync Logs**: All stock synchronization operations  
- **Batch Details**: Success/failure of product sync batches
- **Individual Items**: Success/failure of specific products and variants
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error information for troubleshooting

### Usage
1. **Product Sync**: Click "Sync Products" - see detailed logs in monitoring
2. **Individual Changes**: Product updates trigger logged sync operations
3. **Stock Changes**: Stock moves trigger logged stock sync operations
4. **Monitoring**: View all sync operations with detailed success/error information

### Technical Implementation
- Used `marketplace.sync.log.log_operation()` method for consistency
- Added logs at operation start, success, failure, and exception points
- Included record references (model, ID, name) for traceability
- Added statistics tracking (processed, success, error counts)
- Maintained same logging pattern as existing order pull functionality
